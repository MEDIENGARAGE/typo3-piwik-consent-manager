## ðŸš€ Quick start

Quickstart shows how to embed a YouTube video which is only displayed when a user gives its consent.
A placeholder will be shown if no consent was set or it was declined.

In order to have a basic website for presentation purposes the quick start guide uses https://github.com/benjaminkott/bootstrap_package.
    
1. Create a new content element anywhere on the page and choose YouTube from the new privacy tab:

2. Paste the embed markup into text area and choose a consent type to which the element should react. React means it will be displayed when the user gives its consent on that type. A placeholder image can be set in the image tab.
